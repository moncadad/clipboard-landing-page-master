## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- SCSS

### What I learned

Well this one was a toughy not because of its intrecate design, but because of it's many sections.
On this oneI threw on my trusty thinking hat and thought long and hard. I broke the page down into sections and figured out any repeating factors in order to cut down on any excess amount of code.

Pretty proud of making use of my tools like React, as well as SCSS. I'm not fluent yet, but I know enough atleast for now!

### Continued development

100% looking forward towards when I learn the in's and out's of React. I want to get better at DRY code also. Maybe first I begin by mastering the basics, and let the cool nifty libraries and frameworks for future me.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_positioning.asp) - positioning elements in page using relative.
- [Example resource 2](https://sass-lang.com/guide/) - using scss & property.
